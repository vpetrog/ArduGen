Arduino Function Generator
by Evangelos Petrongonas, hopefully more to join :)

CURRENT STATUS: VERY EARLY DESIGN STAGE

Overview:
SImple Design Function Generator using Arduino UNO and 12bit DAC, with SPI or I2C Interface, (and maybe 9V external supply).

Output:
    Basic Wavefroms like:
        Sine
        Triangle
        Ramp
        Square
DC Offset: TBD (most propably 0 or max 1.5 Vdc)

Specs:
    12bit vertical Accuracy
    Max Output Current:  25 or 100 mA (depends on Negative Supply Design)
Sine
Output Frequency: TBD (in the range of 10-100 KHz)
Amplitude: 3Vpp (+-1.5Vampl) 
Triangle
Ramp
Square

UI
Serial Communication Command Prompt or Pots and Switches (not so likely)

Bill of Materials:
Arduino UNO v3
12bit DAC (Propably MAX 5712)
LM337 Negative Voltage Regulator (Depending on which Negative Supply  is used)
Ultra Low Power OpAmp (TBD)

Currently Working On:
    Design Negative Supply for the output OpAmp. 
    Points to be discussed:
If the Arduino is used for the PWM generation then a Voltage Inverter and Regulator Cip is required such as TL7660,LTC1046,or MAX680-681. The downside is that theese IC's may be difficult to find. Finally the maximum output current of 
 An external supply (9V) is used to supply a NE555 timer in order to create the PWM for the LM337 Voltage Regulator. Moreover the maximum output current f the Generator is increased to 100mA.
     

ToDo:
Specify Generator Characteristics
Create Dropbox/Github Page
Finalise Bill of Materials
Start Working on Arduino Code
Implement SPI Interface 
Test and DEBUG
Work on the rest of the  

Completed:
    
*(D): Design Completed, (UT): Unit Tested, (ST): System Tested.
